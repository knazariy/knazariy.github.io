        <p class="content-header">Short summary</p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">Arena takes place on the continent of Tamriel,
           complete with wilderness, dungeons, cities and villages in a 6 million
           square mile play-space for the player, simulating
           the experience of a full continent.
           Although not as popular as the later games, Arena generated a
           cult following and was successful enough to spawn a popular sequel,
           Daggerfall.</p>

        <p class="content-header">The plot</p>

        <p class="content-paragraph"> <i>"It is said that hope flies on death's wings. Prepare then,
               for as the Elder Scrolls foretold,
              it will be here your adventure begins..."</i> </p>

        <p class="content-paragraph">
          Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn summoned both Emperor Uriel Septim VII
           and General Talin Warhaft on rumors of treachery. But Jagar Tharn
            betrays the two, and transports them into another dimension.
             Tharn's apprentice, Ria Silmane, witnesses his treachery and
              tries to warn the Elder Council, but is killed by Tharn, her
               corporeal form being destroyed by the Staff of Chaos. After
                months of planning, Jagar Tharn transforms himself into the
                 image of the Emperor and takes the throne, summoning demon
                  minions and transforming them into the Emperor's Guard, and
                   sends a low-ranking member of the emperor's court into the
                    Imperial Dungeons to die. Ria Silmane becomes an incorporeal
                     form through the use of magic and remains in this world so
                      that she can warn the prisoner of Jagar Tharn's treachery
                       and that the Emperor is actually Jagar Tharn in disguise.

        <p class="content-paragraph">Ria creates a key for Talin to escape his cell and teleports him to
           another province through the use of a Shift Gate. The only way to
           stop Jagar Tharn is to obtain the Staff of Chaos, in which he holds
            his lifeforce. But the staff has been split by Tharn into eight pieces
             and scattered across Tamriel. Since Talin is the only one that Ria
              Silmane could trust, it is up to him to reassemble the pieces and
               defeat Jager Tharn.
        </p>

        <p class="content-paragraph">Finally, in 3E 399, after a long quest to reassemble the pieces,
          which were hidden at the bottom of a dungeon in each province, the
           prisoner finally reassembles the Staff of Chaos. However, Jagar Tharn
            was not defeated as they and Ria Silmane had hoped. There was one
            final piece in the Imperial Palace, the jewel to the Staff, which
            would make it complete. The prisoner fought their way through the Imperial Palace to the basement level where he fought with Tharn. The prisoner touched the staff to the jewel and they formed instantly, melting Jagar Tharn. The staff creates a portal automatically to the dimension in which the Emperor and General Warhaft are being held. They fall out of the portal and thank the prisoner. The Emperor makes the prisoner the Eternal Champion as a reward for saving them and defeating Jagar Tharn.
